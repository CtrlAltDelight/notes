Every time a random experiment is run, a different outcome might be observed.

How do we describe the experiment mathematically, so that we can analyze the system of interest quantitatively?

# Overview of modleing random experiments
- The outcome of a random experiment is not known in advance, but we define a set of all possible outcomes, called the sample space, and a probability measure on the sample space.

Called an event, instead of which particular outcome occurs
- Each event is assigned a probability of occurrence

- Some mathematical preliminaries
  - basic integration and differentiation
    - polynomials
    - $e^(a x)$
    - chain rule
    - simple integration by parts $integral x e^(lambda x) "dx"$
    - 2d integration (area under a curve)
    - infinite series
      - geometric series $sum_(k=0)^infinity r^k = 1/(1-r)$
    - fundamental theorem of calculus $integral_a^b f'(x) "dx" = f(b) - f(a)$
