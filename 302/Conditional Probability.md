# Conditional Probability

## Motivating example

A blood test for a certain disease.

### Three important questions

What is the Probability that:

1. a person both has the disease and tests positive?
2. a person who tests positive has the disease?
3. a person who has the disease tests positive?

Let $S=\{(0,p),(0,n),(1,p),(1,n)\}$

- 0 ~ no disease
- 1 ~ disease
- p/n ~ tests positive/negative

Let $A=\{\text{person has disease}\}=\{(1,p),(1,n)\}$

Let $B=\{\text{person tests positive}\}=\{(0,p),(1,p)\}$
