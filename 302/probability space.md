How do we model a random experiment mathematically?

We use 3 components:
1. The sample space
- each time the experiment is run, exactly one outcome occurs.
- Examples
    - a binary source generates a bit, then $S=\{0,1\}$ (finite $S$)
    - Count the number of photons hitting a detector, then $S=\{0,1,2,...\}$ (countibly infinite $S$)
    - Measure the temperature in a room. Let $S=[Tmin,Tmax]$ (uncountable $S$)
