$A=(A\cap B) \cup (A \cap B^c)$

$A\cup B = (A\cap B^c)\cup B$

$P(A\cup B) = P(A\cap B^c)\cup P(B)$ by Axiom 3

event as a union of disjoint events, then use axiom 3 (or 4)

- Venn diagram itself is not a proof

Now we have all parts of a probability space $(S,F,P)$
All you need to know about F is:

- F contains subsets of S
- The notation $A\in F$ means A is an event.

## Consider two classic approaches to probability

1. The counting approach
   - Consider a finite sample space $S$
   - $P(A) = \frac{|A|}{|S|} \forall A \in F$
   - Where $|A|$ # of elements in A
2. The relative frequency approach (imperical approach)
   - For a fixed finite $N \ge 1$ let $P(A)=\frac{n_A}{n}$
   - $n_A$ # of times A occurs in n trials of experiment
   - Let $P(A) = \lim\_{n\to\infty} $

It can be shown that the counting probability P and relative frequency of probability P satisfy the axioms!
