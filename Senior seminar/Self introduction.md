Hello, I'm Luke.
I'm studying Computer Engineering with a concentration in software engineering.
I was the head TA for Professor Quinn's 264 class for many semesters.
I really like software
in my free time I enjoy playing bass guitar, building keyboards, ricing my linux desktop, and designing and developing websites using react.

I recently built a portfolio site for my friend who is in the film industry.
