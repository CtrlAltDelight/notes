# Version Control

## Two General approaches

-   Centralized (SVN)
    -   maintain a single master repo that has all versions
    -   access conflicts
-   Distributed (GIT)

    -   multiple versions of component repo that can exist at the same time
    -   merge conflicts

## Bug tracking

-   Depending on software stack, integrated with version control systems there also exist bug tracking software and planners

    -   bitbucket

    **READ ADVANCED GIT BOOK**

-   Git hooks (Very cool)
-   Git submodules ( occasionally useful but pretty hellish: avoid )
-   monorepo (put entire company onto one repo)

-   For phase 1
    -   okay to branch off main and merge back to main
-   For phase 2
    -   may want a development branch
