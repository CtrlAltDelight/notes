## Global Teams

-   Why hire team members around the world
    -   Different perspectives
    -   Cheaper labor
    -   Closer to clients
    -   Need active teams at all hours
-   Business trips
    -   Costs of sending an employee to Beijing to visit other team
        -   Air fair
        -   Opportunity cost of person not working
        -   People in Beijing not working since they are talking to visiting teammate
    -   Benefits
        -   Face to a name means better cooperation
        -   Gets to bring back knowledge/tools from Beijing
        -   Beijing gets to learn knowledge/tools from America
    -   Will this happen?
        -   Depends on company culture

## Effect of human culture on software engineering work

-   Hofstede's model of culture
    -   Power distance
        -   e.g. calling professor "Professor Davis" vs. "Jamie"
        -   What the person in power says goes vs. giving feedback and pushback
    -   short/long-term orientation
        -   How much value you place on things far in the future vs. soon vs. recent past.
    -   Individualism/Collectivism
        -   degree of interdependence. "me" vs "we"
        -   China tends to be "we" - makes decisions as a group. Hesitant to make decisions as individual. Want to know what teammates think.
        -   Us tends to be "me" - one person may make a decision without asking.
-   General trend: "The West and the Rest"
